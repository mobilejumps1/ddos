	Simple Anti DDOS Bash Script

Let me demonstrate a basic protection usage:
	
	Only port 80, 443 are allowed by default to your server, 
	this allows web traffic to reach your server on both port 80(http) or 443(https)
	
	Management port 2200 is whitelisted and allowed connection to the server, for managing purpose.
	
	All other connection are blocked.  
	
	This also make you invincible to many script kiddies, since your server will not respond to
	any ping from outsite the world.

	You will get 'Request timed out.'
